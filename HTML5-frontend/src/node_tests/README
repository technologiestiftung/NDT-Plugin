These tests use node.js and the ws library for node.js to run the client side
of NDT tests that speak to a server using websockets.

They can only be run on a system that has node.js, and the ws libraries. At
last look, the documentation for ws can be found at:
   http://einaros.github.io/ws/

This code also serves as documentation for how to write your own javascript
client for NDT.

If you have node.js and the node package manager npm, then the ws library may
be installed via:
   npm install ws
